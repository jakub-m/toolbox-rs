## Running

```
cargo build --relase
./xbar_pagerduty.sh
```

For **development** (when run from within the git repository) the script uses
`cargo run` instead of release target.

## Installation

To install from source:

```sh
$ git clone git@github.com:jakub-m/toolbox-rs.git
$ cargo build --release
$ ln -s $(realpath xbar_pagerduty_plugin.sh) "$HOME/Library/Application Support/xbar/plugins/pagerduty.5m.sh"
```

If you don't have the Rust toolchain installed you can also go to [releases][releases] and grab the prebuilt binary. Then you need to extract the files, place them in one directory and execute:

```sh
ln -s $(realpath xbar_pagerduty_plugin.sh) "$HOME/Library/Application Support/xbar/plugins/pagerduty.5m.sh"
```

You can also place `xbar_pagerduty_plugin.sh` in the plugins folder manually, just make sure to change the path pointing to `xbar_pagerduty.sh`.
